# Bounce!
Put your programming knowledge to the test by making an SVG ball do something quirky or creative. Familiarize yourself with the single component Vue project and get going! You can change anything you want, but you shouldn't need to change much more than bounce.ts and Bounce.vue. 

Note that the `bounce()` function is called every 100ms, this is where you can start tinkering.
